# Question 1: VueJS

Create a simple counter component using Vue.js. The component should have the following features:
- A display area showing the current count.
- Buttons to increment and decrement the count.
- A button to reset the count to zero.

The provided starter code includes only the `.vue` Single-File Component. **You do not need to load the component into a VueJS application, but you may do so if you wish.** Our goal is to evaluate your knowledge of VueJS—or your ability to pick it up—but we are not concerned with minor syntax or API mistakes.

**Note:** If you are more comfortable using another frontend framework (like React), you may do so, but you will not have starter code.

## Additional Notes

If you'd like, use this space to include thoughts, questions, or documentation you'd like to supplement your code.

Just a bit of background, I am not super familiar with Vue, certainly not outside of some small personal projects. The documentation provided was super helpful though and helped me to pick up what I needed very quickly. 
I was able to read the documentation provided and have a working model running in the Vue SFC Playground (https://play.vuejs.org) fairly quickly. One of the things I am the most proud of is my ability to pick up new skills
(like frameworks and languages) quickly and I hope that this was a helpful demonstration of that.
